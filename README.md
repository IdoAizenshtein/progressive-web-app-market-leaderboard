## 💻 Development

The application uses a modular JavaScript structure:

- `app.js`: Application initialization and configuration
- `router.js`: Client-side navigation and route handling
- `store.js`: Data management, API interactions, and local storage
- View controllers in `js/views/` handle specific UI components and user interactions

2. Register new routes in `router.js`
3. Update the service worker cache in `sw.js` for new assets

3. In Chrome/Edge: Click the menu (⋮) > "Install App"
4. In Safari (iOS): Click share icon > "Add to Home Screen"

## 🔄 Data Synchronization
